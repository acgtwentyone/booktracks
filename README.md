# Book Tracks
A react native book tracks app.

A simple books app. The idea is to make this a tool where users can register their own books, as well as reading online registred books. 
A person can also add his pages, add a book to favourities books, delete a book and son on... Also as well as generate reports, such as most readed user books and so on.
