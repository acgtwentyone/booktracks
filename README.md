# booktracks
This repository contains files for the react native book tracks app 

A simple books app. The idea is to make this a tool where users can register their own books, as well as reading online registred books. 
A person can also add his pages, add a book to favourities books, delete a book and son on...

The app is also intended to show recents users actions, by that i mean recents added books, added to favourities, and recent pages added.
